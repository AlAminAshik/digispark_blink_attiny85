//This code shows how to upload simple blink code to digispark attiny85 board
//digispark board only stays at program mode for 5seconds after plugged in to computer
//so initiate upload process and the serial monitor will ask to plugin the device
//then insert the device and the code will be uploaded to the board
//if you program the board externally using arduino as ISP programmer, this method will not work anymore
//"upload_protocol = micronucleus" this line is added to initiate the upload process in platformio.ini file
